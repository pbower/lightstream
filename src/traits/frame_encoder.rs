//! # Generic Frame Encoder
//!
//! Serialise your protocol frames into **on-the-wire bytes** efficiently.
//!
//! **Why this is useful**
//! - Central place to define how a frame becomes a byte sequence (length-prefix, TLV, IPC, â€¦).
//! - Keeps responsibility for buffer management with the caller.
//! - Plays nicely with any sink (files, sockets, custom transports).
//!
//! Implement `FrameEncoder` for your format; call `encode()` to append the wire bytes into a buffer.

use crate::traits::stream_buffer::StreamBuffer;

/// Implement this trait for any wire format requiring message serialisation,
/// such as Arrow IPC, protobuf, or custom binary protocols.
///
/// The encoder must only append to the provided buffer and must not retain references
/// or have side-effects to any data passed in.
///
/// ### Safety Contract
/// - The encoder must not mutate the frame being encoded.
/// - The encoder must not retain references to input data after the call.
/// - All writes must be bounded to the provided buffer.
pub trait FrameEncoder {
    /// The type of frame accepted by this encoder.

    /// The type of metadata produced by this encoder.
    type Metadata;

    /// Encode a frame, producing both an output buffer and frame metadata.
    ///
    /// Returns an owned buffer containing the encoded frame and the associated metadata.
    /// Returns `Err` if encoding fails.
    ///
    /// ### Args
    /// * `global_offset`: keeps track of the pointer position across frames
    /// * `frame`: the frame being encoded
    fn encode<'a, B: StreamBuffer>(
        global_offset: &mut usize,
        frame: &Self::Frame<'a>,
    ) -> io::Result<(B, Self::Metadata)>;
