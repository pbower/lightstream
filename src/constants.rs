//! # IPC Constants
//!
//! Constants used by the Arrow IPC framing and Lightstreamâ€™s framing logic.
//!
//! These cover frame sizing, magic numbers, and special markers required by the
//! Arrow IPC file and stream format. They are kept in one place for clarity and
//! to ensure consistency across encoders, decoders, readers, and writers, and are
//! consistent with the [Apache Arrow specification](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#ipc-file-format).
